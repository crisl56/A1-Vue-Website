A2: Running App



\# Goals

Create a functional, reusable components while practicing Vue Fundamentals.

Connect with MongoDB and SQL to store data



\# Context

Currently there is a home page, about page, contact page, login, and a leaderboard page



home page has 2 components a clicker and a summary of the leaderboard from the backend



about page is just text saying what the site is about



contact page is my contacts along with a feedback component that logs the feedback

login page lets you register and login an account to the server



leaderboardpage is the full leaderboard from the backend along with a guide component and cool button component



\# How to run

run both backend and frontend and go the frontend link.

if tsx or vue is not install please install before running



the .env has also been deleted to stay safe.

it is 100% safer within this text file:





here is the .env contents



``` 
sqlDB\_HOST=localhost

sqlDB\_USER=root

sqlDB\_PASSWORD=spencer

sqlDB\_NAME=vfs

sqlPORT=3306



PORT=3000



MONGODB\_URI=mongodb+srv://crislaurenceodonel\_db\_user:spencer@spencergonk.grpabyh.mongodb.net/?appName=SpencerGonk

MONGOPORT=3000;
```

copy and past this into a .env file within the backend



use npm install to setup things like mongoose and sql
